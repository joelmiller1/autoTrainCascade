How to train and create your own Cascade Classifier. Most of this info is located at https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/dc/d88/tutorial_traincascade.html

__Step 1__ -
Try to run the programs located in the opencv folder for use of createsamples.exe and traincascade.exe before proceeding. If it works, great. If not keep reading Step 1

Download and install/extract files from https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/3.4.8 . If you are on windows then get the 
vc-14/15 files. It downloads an exe file. If you run the exe file then it basically is a 7zip extracter that unzips all the files
you need. Pretty sketchy, but yolo. The files you need to run the programs are located in the extracted_files_loc/build/x64/vc15/bin/.
You really only need those files, so you can copy the entire contents of the folder to wherever directory you want or reference that
folder's location. 

__Step 2__ - 
Put your video into a folder named vids and then run the automate.py program. ///finish later///
